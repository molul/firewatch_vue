A client requests a SPA from us to show real-time information about the forest fires detected in Castilla y León (Spain) during the last two years. To do this, we use an open data API from: https://analisis.datosabiertos.jcyl.es/api/explore/v2.1/console

Basic requirements:
	-(DONE) Show a table with as much data as possible that the open API can provide.
	-The data table will have filters that will allow the user to display information filtered by: 
		Province, 
		probable cause, 
		Current situation, 
		Maximum level reached.
	-This application must contain an interactive map to geo-position the fires.

Evaluable requirements:
	-The user will be able to store the configuration of selected filters in the browser's local storage.
	-The application will have data entry to search for nearby fires (e.g. 10km radius) at given GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude).

BONUS requirements:
	-(DONE) Develop code using Vue.js
	-(DONE) Deploy the webapp on a free server
	-(DONE) The componentization of the interface will be positively valued so that it can be integrated into other SPAs.
	-Project/code documentation
	-Some unitary tests

Delivery:
	-Delivering the code within the first 48 hours after the beggining of the test will be very positively valued
	-Use the link down below to send the code repository where it is hosted (GitHub, GitLab...)
	-The code will need to be documented so that it can be compiled and tested on a web server. You don't need to include personal API keys in your code.
